"Champaign-Urbama Mass Transit District (CUMTD) + LED Matrix"

## What it do?
**CUM-MATRIX** combines the [CUMTD API](https://developer.cumtd.com/) and a [64x32 LED Matrix](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32754106669.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.13f74c4dBgaicE) to make a mini timetable of CUMTD bus departures. The board refreshes every 30 seconds, and can display 4 bus times at once -- cycling between two screens with two times each, similar to a real timetable. Cool!
